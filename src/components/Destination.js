          of the island of Luzon. They were formed by the subduction of the
          Eurasian Plate underneath the Philippine Mobile Belt. Taal Lake lies
          within caldera formed by explosive eruptions between 140,000 and 5,380
          BP. Each of these eruptions created extensive ignimbrite deposits
          reaching as far away as present-day Manila."
